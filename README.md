## Projects
### [Turbojet Engine Simulator](https://github.com/emersonbeehler/turbojetsimulator/)
Python app that uses user-defined parameters to calculate the performance of a turbojet engine using the ideal Brayton cycle. Outputs key performance metrics (e.g. thrust), and generates temperature and pressure graphs for each stage in the cycle.

### [Highschool Projects](https://github.com/emersonbeehler/highschool-projects)
Collection of small group and individual projects I worked on in high school. Includes a Mars egg drop lander, an investigation on the relation between wing area and lift generated by a paper airplane, and an investigation on the impact of the wavelength of light and the refractive index.
